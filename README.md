# Basic-Python-Login-System
Did a complete recode and overhaul of the last version. This one stores your credentials in usernames.txt and the code is easier to understand now. (Pls note im a beginner so its not gonna be that good)

A complete, basic login system with sign up feature and captcha.

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE 'username.txt' IN DIRECTORY OR PACKAGE(comes with this package)

Just run main.py and use the commands 1 or 2 or 3.

1 for Login

2 for Signup

3 to quit

It will ask you to solve a very easy captchas.

Enjoy. :P
