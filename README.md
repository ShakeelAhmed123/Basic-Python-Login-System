# Basic-Python-Login-System
Use LoginSystem2.0 as that is the new version

Added the .exe file so anyone can use it. Download release v2.1 source code and the exe is gonna be in the LoginSystemv2.0.exe

Did a complete recode and overhaul of the last version. This one stores your credentials in usernames.txt and the code is easier to understand now. (Pls note im a beginner so its not gonna be that good)

A complete, basic login system with sign up feature and captcha.

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE 'username.txt' IN DIRECTORY OR PACKAGE (the file does comes with this package)

Just run main.py and use the commands 1 or 2 or 3.

1 for Login

2 for Signup

3 to quit

It will ask you to solve a very easy captchas.

Enjoy. :P
